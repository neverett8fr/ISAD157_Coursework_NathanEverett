This is coursework created by me at my time in University at Plymouth. This application uses a remote MySQL database which is accessed using various queries, etc.

Application Description:

Once the application has started up, the functions can be found fairly simply by clicking on buttons and tabs which are labelled.
The application has a few main functions: Loading data from CSV file, loading data from a MySQL database, and filtering this data.
When the application is started the user will see a blank page with the title: "User Profile"; the empty space will be populated once data has been loaded.
Once loaded, the data will displayed on the right hand side of the page - with the ability to change tabled viewed using the combobox / dropdown menu which should be populated automatically.
Clicking on different tabs within the application lead to different pages with different functions: page 1 - a user profile, page 2 - a place to submit queries to filter the data on the left hand side of the page.


How to use the application:

First you have to be connected to the University of Plymouth servers via VPN or being directly there to load data from the database.
To view data on the left hand side of the screen, click either: "Select Data Source" to load the data from a database, or "Load From CSV" to view a CSV file represented as a table.
If you select "Select Data Source" an option will come up to either "Use preset MySQL Connection" or "Setup" a new one, choose whichever you prefer. Once loaded a message will pop-up, you can use the dropdown to select the table in the database you want to view.
If "Select Data Source" chosen the user can click on any cell in the table shown to populate the right side of the screen with user info - may have to click a few times (it's sometimes fiddly).
Change tabs to view other information
Fill out search results and click "Go" to load queried results into a table on the right hand side of the page
